# Â» Welcome to Frontity

**ðŸ‘‹** Hi! Welcome to Frontity, and to our documentation pages. This is where you will find all the information you need to build something awesome with Frontity.

Let's kick things off by providing you with a roadmap so that you can find your way around the documentation and zero in on the information you need right now.

## **Getting Started**

If you're new to Frontity then you can get started by heading over to, erm..., the [**Getting Started**](getting-started/) section.

This is where you'll find our [**Quick Start Guide**](getting-started/quick-start-guide.md) that will get you up and running with Frontity quickly. In particular we would like to draw your attention to the [**Initial checks**](https://docs.frontity.org/getting-started#initial-checks) section.

Once you've followed the Quick Start Guide and have a working Frontity installation we'll show you how to [**connect Frontity up to your own WordPress site**](getting-started/connecting-to-wordpress.md) and also how to customise the menu to reflect the structure of your WordPress site.

## **Learning Frontity**

This section is the heart of our documentation. Once you've nailed the basics in the Getting Started section you should head over to the [**Learning Frontity**](learning-frontity/) section to really dig in to the detail and learn how to work with Frontity.

## **Architecture and Deployment**

Find out about how the relationship between Frontity and WordPress is structured in the [**Architecture**](https://github.com/frontity/docs/tree/1a3f3a66fb661dd5b4c485006d09a9ea5caf7598/docs/architecture/README.md) section and, once you have a working application that you're happy with, how to deploy to live in the [**Deployment**](deployment/) section.

## **Packages and Themes**

In reality a Frontity theme is just a special instance of a Frontity package. Really **everything** is a package when you're working with Frontity.

Frontity comes with a number of useful packages for routing, API source, and so on. You can learn all about each of them in the section entitled [**Frontity Packages**](api-reference-1/).

The included themes, namely Mars and TwentyTwenty, are dealt with separately from the other packages under the [**Frontity Themes**](frontity-themes/) section.

## **Guides**

This is where you'll find an ever-growing series of [**Guides**](guides/). Some will help you in working with Frontity. Others will give you ideas for projects and provide you with the help you need to guide you from first steps to fully working project.

This is where you can really have fun with Frontity and work toward your stretch goals.

## **Contributing**

Frontity is an open source project and we welcome contributions from the community. The [**Contributing**](contributing/) section of the documentation will guide you whether you want to make a single contribution or whether you intend to become a fully fledged contributor to the Frontity project.

We can't wait to see where you take Frontity in the future.

## **And that's not all**

There's yet more to the Frontity documentation.

[**Frontity's WordPress Plugins**](frontity-plugins/) are plugins built by the team here at Frontity that you install and activate in your WordPress site and that will enhance your Frontity site.

[**Key Concepts**](resources/) will help you with some foundational knowledge that will assist you when working with Frontity. Here we even provide you with introductions to JavaScript/ES6 and React, just in case you need them.

[**FAQ**](faq.md) Frequently Asked Questions - but you already knew that, didn't you?! ðŸ˜€

By the way, we'd love to hear about what you're building with Frontity. Join us in our [**Community Forum**](https://community.frontity.org) and tell us about your project. You can also ask questions and get help and support from our growing community of users and developers there.

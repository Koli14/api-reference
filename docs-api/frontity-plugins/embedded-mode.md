# Frontity Embedded Mode

This plugin enables an **Embedded Mode** implementation of Frontity. It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/frontity/frontity-embedded).

Embedded Mode can be contrasted with **Decoupled Mode**. In Decoupled Mode the primary domain points to the Frontity site, with the WordPress site being on a secondary domain or on a subdomain of the primary domain.

In Embedded Mode the primary domain points to the WordPress site, and the Frontity site can be on another domain including the default URL provided by a free hosting service such as [Vercel](https://docs.frontity.org/deployment/deploy-using-vercel).

This plugin replaces the active WordPress theme with the Frontity installation. Frontity therefore effectively becomes the WordPress sites' theme. It works by substituting it's own [`template.php`](https://github.com/frontity/frontity-embedded/blob/master/includes/template.php) in place of any call made to the [WordPress template hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/).

## Advantages of Embedded Mode

Embedded Mode offers several advantages over Decoupled Mode.

- The WordPress site exists under the primary domain. This ensures that:
  - the SEO of the site is not compromised
  - sitemaps generated by WordPress/Yoast/All-in-one-SEO work as normal
  - caching plugins continue to work as normal
- Content producers/editors continue to have the same experience
  - post/page preview remains available
  - the admin bar is active for logged in users

## Disdvantages of Embedded Mode

- Frontity still needs to be hosted on a separate node server/serverless function (albeit on any domain you like including default domains provided by the hosting provider)
- WordPress still needs to go through it's [bootstrap process](https://wordpress.tv/2017/06/22/alain-schlesser-demystifying-the-wordpress-bootstrap-process/) on initial page load
- more routing is involved (WordPress makes a call to Frontity which returns the HTML to WordPress) so a caching plugin is a necessity rather than simply a nice to have. (We recommend [Simple Cache](https://github.com/luisherranz/simple-cache))

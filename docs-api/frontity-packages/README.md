# üç± Frontity Packages

Frontity projects are built around the idea of packages that encapsulates logic that can be reused across projects. Frontity packages may be considered as the equivalent of WordPress plugins.  They're the ingredients of the final Frontity project.

## How to use Frontity packages

Frontity packages are available available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:frontity) and they can be installed as dependencies of your Frontity project (as with any other Node project). 

But installing these packages (and adding them as dependencies) is not enough, they also need to be properly defined and configured (under their proper Namespace) and as part of your Frontity project in the file `frontity.settings.js`

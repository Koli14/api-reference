# @frontity/hooks

This package is a collection of React hooks that have proven to be pretty useful for a Frontity project.

## Installation

Add the `@frontity/hooks` package to your project:

```text
npm i @frontity/hooks
```

## How to use

In order to use it, you just have to import the hook you want to use in your theme from `@frontity/hooks` and place it wherever needed. For example, if we want to use the `useInView` hook:

```javascript
import useInView from "@frontity/hooks/use-in-view";
```

## Hooks

### `useInView`

It tracks when an element enters or leaves the viewport.

The hook just wraps the [`react-intersection-observer`](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer) library which uses internally the [`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver) API. As some old browsers don't support it, `useInView` also returns a `supported` prop indicating if it's supported or not.

#### Parameters

It accepts a single object with the following props:

| Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`root`** | Element | window | false | The Element that is used as the viewport for checking visibility of the target. Defaults to the browser viewport \(`window`\) if not specified or if null. |
| **`rootMargin`** | string | '0px' | false | Margin around the root. Can have values similar to the CSS margin property, e.g. "10px 20px 30px 40px" \(top, right, bottom, left\). |
| **`threshold`** | number \| number\[\] | 0 | false | Number between 0 and 1 indicating the percentage that should be visible before triggering. Can also be an array of numbers, to create multiple trigger points. |
| **`triggerOnce`** | boolean | false | false | Only trigger this method once |

#### Return value

An object with the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`ref`** | React.RefObject | React reference object pointing to the DOM element. It must be passed to the element you want to track. |
| **`inView`** | boolean | Boolean indicating if the element is visible. The value is always `true` if **`supported`** is `false`. |
| **`supported`** | boolean | Boolean indicating if [`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver) is supported by the browser. |

#### Usage

```javascript
import useInView from "@frontity/hooks/use-in-view";

const MyLazyElement = ({ children }) => {
  // Get the reference and the visibility status.
  const { ref, inView } = useInView({ triggerOnce: true });

  // Pass the reference to the container and render `children` if
  // the container is visible, or a placeholder otherwise.
  return <div ref={ref}>{inView ? children : <MyPlaceholder />}</div>;
};
```

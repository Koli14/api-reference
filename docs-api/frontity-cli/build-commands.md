# Build commands

These commands will allow you generate the code that can be used to run or analyze a Frontity project

* [`build`](build-commands.md#build)

{% hint style="info" %}
Have a look at the [environment variables](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-cli/environment-variables) page to check which ones can be used with these commands
{% endhint %}

## `build`

Builds the project for production.

```text
npx frontity build [options]
```

The [`frontity serve`](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-cli/run-commands#serve) command will use the files generated by this `frontity build` command.

### Arguments

#### **`[options]`**

| Option | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| `--development` | Builds the project for development. Related environment variable: [`FRONTITY_BUILD_DEVELOPMENT`](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-cli/environment-variables#frontity_build_development) |
| `--target <target>` | Create bundles with "es5", "module" or "both". Default target is "both".  Related environment variable: [`FRONTITY_BUILD_TARGET`](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-cli/environment-variables#frontity_build_target) |
| [`--publicPath <path>`](build-commands.md#the-publicpath-option) | Set the [public path](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/) for static assets. Default path is "/static/". Related environment variable: [`FRONTITY_BUILD_PUBLIC_PATH`](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-cli/environment-variables#frontity_build_public_path)|
| `--help` | Output usage information |

**Examples**

* Builds the project for production using an external domain `https://external-domain.com/static` as the path for static files

```text
npx frontity build --public-path="https://external-domain.com/static"
```

#### The `--development` option

This flag correspond to [webpack’s mode parameter](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/) so it will run webpack in the development mode as described [there](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/).

For example, when running react in development mode \(when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is set to `development` and NOT to `production`\) you get [full error messages and warnings](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build) from React but at the cost of slower performance.

```text
npx frontity build --development
```

So, it’s basically the same as just running `frontity dev` except that it will only build the project `once` and will **not run the development server**.

#### The `--public-path` option

By default Frontity will look for static assets in the path `<YOUR-DOMAIN>/static`

With the `--public-path` option you can change the path from where you are serving the statics assets \(i.e. js chunk files, fonts, images, etc.\)

The [public path is included in the generated files by webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/) and cannot be changed after that.

In case some people need to change it \(because of constrains in their site architecture\) they would need an option to do so just before generating the Frontity bundle with `npx frontity build`.

{% hint style="info" %}
This option is also available for [`dev`](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-cli/run-commands#dev) command
{% endhint %}


_Example:_

```text
npx frontity build --public-path="/other/folder"
```

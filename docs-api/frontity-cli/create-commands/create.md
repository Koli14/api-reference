## `create`

Creates a new Frontity project.

```text
npx frontity create [project-name] [options]
```

### Arguments

#### `[project-name]`

The _name_ of your Frontity project. It will also be the name of the folder that this command will create for you with the files of your Frontity project inside

#### `[options]`

| Option | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| `--theme <theme>` | The theme to use |
| `--typescript` | Adds support for TypeScript |
| `--use-cwd` | Generates the project in the current directory |
| [`--no-prompt`](../environment-variables#frontity_name) | Skips prompting the user for options. Related environment variable: [`FRONTITY_NAME`](../environment-variables#frontity_name).|
| `--help` | Output usage information |

#### The `--theme` option

You can pick one of Frontity's "official" two themes ([`--theme @frontity/mars-theme`](https://github.com/frontity/frontity/tree/dev/packages/mars-theme) or [`--theme @frontity/twentytwenty-theme`](https://github.com/frontity/frontity/tree/dev/packages/twentytwenty-theme)). But you can also use any custom theme as long as it's [published on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:frontity-theme). Just pass the theme name on the command-line like `--theme ThemesPackageNameInNPM`

### Examples

* Create a Frontity project named `my-awesome-project`

```text
npx frontity create my-awesome-project
```

* Create a Frontity project named `my-awesome-project` using [Frontity Chakra theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/frontity-chakra-theme)

```text
npx frontity create --theme frontity-chakra-theme cool-project
```

* If you leave out both of the arguments, the CLI will run an interactive shell asking for these inputs:

```text
